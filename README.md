## Inspiration
FurniShare was inspired by the growing need to promote sustainability in our communities. Every year, tons of furniture ends up in landfills, even though many of these items could still be used. At the same time, people looking to furnish their homes often face financial or logistical challenges. FurniShare aims to bridge this gap by connecting donors with recipients, making furniture donation seamless and accessible.

## What it does
FurniShare is a platform where users can:
- Donate furniture by creating detailed listings with descriptions, locations, and images.
- Browse available listings based on their location and preferences.
- Connect with donors or recipients to arrange pickup or delivery.

The platform encourages sustainability while fostering local connections.

## How we built it
We built FurniShare using the following tools and technologies:
- **Frontend**: Next.js for a fast and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: A PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon for managing user accounts and furniture listings.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on Vercel for scalability and ease of use.
- **Authentication**: Implemented secure sign-up and sign-in functionality to protect user data.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Authentication**: Integrating user authentication while ensuring it was secure and easy to use.
- **Database Design**: Structuring the database to handle user accounts and furniture listings efficiently, including optional features like images and search filters.
- **Time Constraints**: Prioritizing features to build a functional and impactful project within the limited time frame of the hackathon.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating a fully functional platform that enables users to donate and browse furniture.
- Implementing a smooth user authentication flow with sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
- Designing a visually appealing interface with responsive layouts for a seamless user experience.

## What we learned
- The importance of efficient team collaboration and problem-solving under time constraints.
- How to integrate modern web technologies, such as Next.js and PostgreSQL, to build scalable applications.
- The value of user-centric design when creating a product that solves real-world problems.

## What's next for FurniShare
- **Messaging System**: Adding a built-in messaging feature for donors and recipients to communicate securely.
- **Enhanced Filters**: Allowing users to filter listings by categories, distance, or pickup types.
- **Mobile App**: Expanding FurniShare to a mobile application for even greater accessibility.
- **Analytics**: Providing insights into the number of items donated and their environmental impact.
